    <h1>Finding a Specific Order_item #6, where the total price is greater than 30</h1>
    
    <p>In this exercise, I was looking for a specific item which is Order # 6. I added the "WHERE and the AND" clause. </p>
    <!-- Inserting text and image -->

    </div>
    <p>I used the SELECT * FROM order_items to get the data from the order_items table and added the WHERE order_id that is equal to 6, then added "AND unit_price * quantity that is greater than 30" to filter out a specific order_item #6 and that the total price is more than 30.</p>
